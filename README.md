# KNN and K-means Clustering for Data Science Salary Analysis

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze data science salaries using machine learning techniques, specifically K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and K-means clustering. By applying these algorithms to a dataset of data science salaries, we aim to gain insights into the factors that influence salary levels and identify distinct salary clusters within the data.

### Methodology
The project follows a two-step approach. First, we employ K-nearest neighbors (KNN) to predict salary levels based on the available features. KNN is a supervised learning algorithm that identifies the K most similar data points to a given observation and predicts its outcome based on the majority class of its neighbors.

Next, we employ K-means clustering to identify distinct salary clusters within the dataset. K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups similar data points together based on their feature similarity. This allows us to identify patterns and clusters within the salary data, providing insights into salary segmentation.

### Results
The project aims to provide several key outcomes:

Predictive Salary Analysis: By utilizing KNN, we can predict salary levels based on the provided features. This can help individuals and organizations understand which factors contribute most to salary variations in the data science field.

Salary Cluster Identification: Through K-means clustering, we can identify distinct salary clusters within the dataset. This can help reveal salary patterns and provide a deeper understanding of different salary segments in the data science industry.
